# Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game Library
I'm hoping this could be a universal vsrg library that other engines could extend from.

## Goal
Extensibility on a rich library that covers new and old formats

### Extensibility
You can view how you can extend from this repository by looking at my [Examples](examples.md)

## Main Features
Everything is documented in [Road Map](roadmap.md). I will list everything that will be implemented and possibly more over time.
