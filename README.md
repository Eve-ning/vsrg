# A static vsrg library
I'm hoping this could be a universal vsrg library that other engines could extend from

## Goal
Extensibility on a rich library

## Main Features expected

**conversion from all games**
- [ ] osu!mania
- [ ] bms
- [ ] sm
- [ ] o2jam
 
**data mangling**
- [ ] TimingPoint functions
- [ ] HitObject functions
- [ ] OtherNoteTypes (extends HitObject) function

**fully documented with doxygen**
- [ ] Ported to github wiki

### Expected to be easily extendable
All class are made such that it's easy to inherit from with the necessary virtual functions in place.
